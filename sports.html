			<h1> Rugby: </h1>
			<font size="+2">
			Rugby has been a very big and important aspect of my life from a very young age. I started playing rugby when I <br>
			was about 5 years old at my local club, Waterpark R.F.C., a club where my family before me had spent their <br>
			years playing at. The club has produced excellent teams throughout the years that have gone on to win provincial and <br>
			natioal titles such as the PAN Munster U16, U18 and the All-Ireland U18 Cup as well as dominating the East Munster Cup<br>
			throughout the past few years. I loved every second of my time at Waterpark and remember fondly all the memories I have<br>
			 of playing in the Black and Red Jersey.

			 <h2> Hurling:</h2>
			 Another of my main sporting interests would have to be hurling. The GAA has a big influence in my life. I play for Ballgunner, my local club,<br>
			 and through it I've made lifelong friends. I also use hurling not only as a form of excercise but also as an outlet or break away from all the<br>
			 other things in my life whether that is from college work or part time work. It acts as a stress reliever and even anytime that I may<br>
			 have worries all I have to do is go outside and pick up the hurley and it does the world of good.

			<h2> Gaelic Football:</h2>
			I've always been passionate about playing football but out of all my sports it's the one where I can relax the most and just enjoy playing<br>
			because growing up in Waterford football wasn't exactly a competitive sport. It's mostly played in the summer for a bit of a laugh but that's<br>
			one of the reasons I enjoy it so much. I don't have to take it as seriously as my rugby or hurling as there isn't a lot of competitive <br>
			tournaments. It's mostly just played as challenge matches between the differnt parishes. It's always good to play a sport where there isn't<br>
			the added pressure of trying to win a cup or a league and that's why I've love my time playing for Gailltir.
