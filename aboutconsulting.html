    <h1>Hyperautomation:</h1>
    Hyper-automation “deals with the application of advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), to increasingly automate processes and augment humans. Hyper-automation extends across a range of tools that can be automated, but also refers to the sophistication of the automation (i.e., discover, analyse, design, automate, measure, monitor, reassess.)” <br>

In simple terms, hyper-automation refers to the mixture of automation technologies that exist to augment and expand human capabilities. <br>

How is Hyper-automation Different from Regular Automation?<br>

When we think of automation, terms like robotic process automation come to mind. But, hyper-automation takes an ecosystem of technologically advanced tools and combines them to create a new way to work. <br>

It means that low-value tasks are optimally performed with automation tools, machine learning and advanced artificial intelligence so that outputs can be produced automatically and run efficiently with little to no human intervention. Then, together with humans, hyper-automation can create a workplace that is always informed, agile and able to use data and insights for quick and accurate decision-making.<br> Ref:https://www.solvexia.com/blog/what-is-hyperautomation-a-complete-guide<br>

<h1> Multiexperience: </h1>
Multiexperience is a concept pioneered by Gartner late in 2019. The concept is being championed as one of the biggest developments for 2020. In fact, Gartner states that “more than 25% of the mobile apps, progressive web apps and conversational apps at large enterprises will be built and/or run through a multiexperience development platform” by 2023.<br>

In short, multiexperience is about adapting to the increasing market of different devices and their respective experiences. Applications now need to run on different platforms and adapt easily, all while providing a consistent experience from a business perspective.<br>

Why is this relevant? For one, it’s because a few companies are already doing it and, for another, it’s because the average individual currently owns 3.2 different devices. In other words, it’s becoming the increasingly expected norm.<br>

But, other than a few key examples, little more is known than this. This is where we’re here to help.<br>

<h1> Distributed Cloud: </h1>
Distributed cloud is the application of cloud computing technologies to interconnect data and applications served from multiple geographic locations.<br>

Distributed, in an information technology (IT) context, means that something is shared among multiple systems which may also be in different locations. Distributed cloud speeds communications for global services and enables more responsive communications for specific regions.<br>
